quote from the book"Virus scanners typically do not detect these files (the majority are Unix-based), but their activity could be detected by a well-configured IDS. However, if proper attention is given to their use, even detection will not supply the victim with much information"

all true but with Nohidy we much easier find out what ports the system is lissening
