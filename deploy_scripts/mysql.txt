DONT FORGET TO RUN mysql_secure_installation script after u have installed mysql

#This is a good way to handle mysql servers(assuming that you have more then one) on linux

stuff i will use: socat, mysql(use the default or mariadb, whatever suits you best), iptables

so i will be talking about 3 networks (with one server on each network)

A
home-net - our private network that is guarded by firewalls and other stuff, its a homenetwork without a DMZ

B
vps1 -  high bandwith vps somewhere on earth

C
vps2 - simular to vps1


Goal:
setup a working mysql sync/replication so that server B and C is gathering data and saves it in server A

so what i like to do is to create a proxy for the mysql unix socket, i use socat cuz socat is amazing
so i will only allow server B and C to connect to server A

i will create 2 different mysql users and two different socat listeners one for each server so if one of the servers gets
hacked i can simply close the connection without affecting the other slave server

----
Side-Note:
accourding to the internet(forums and so on) you can use multiple ips in one iptable command/rule but i havent got this working (divided by ',') 
----


Tha rules:
socat -v tcp-l:1337,reuseaddr,fork unix:/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 1337 ! -s input.ur.ip.here -j DROP

help:
iptables rule = noone but this ip is allowed
socat rule = create a tcp listner and reuseadder to loop it (= not die after the first connection) with the mysql unix socket

create a tmux shell and input the iptables and socat rule twice but with different ports/ips for server B and C 

verify that it went in:
iptables -L
nc -nv 0.0.0.0 port1
nc -nv 0.0.0.0 port2
