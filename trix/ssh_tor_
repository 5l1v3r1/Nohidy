quick guide on how to use ssh with tor to secure ur ssh


go to ssh's configuration file and bind ssh to 127.0.0.1 so that we only get 
localconnections instead of 0.0.0.0
service ssh reload && service ssh restart

open torrc
vim /etc/tor/torrc
add the lines:
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh_service/
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22

save it
service tor reload && service tor restart
now cat the hostname: cat /var/lib/tor/ssh_service/hostname
ssh to that
torify ssh ursite.onion

if you portscan the servers ip you should see that port 22 is no longer open
